### Personal project

This is my first big project, which I managed myself, it's nowhere near perfection, but in the process of making it, I learned a lot through struggle, like SafariServices, Gestures working with grids of items, Unsplash API, Combine, converting images into data and saving them and much more. It was the hardest project I've made by far.
So basically it replicates a fraction of the functionality of the original app like creating collections with links for further use, editing them, and syncing them with a website.
It was built under the guidance of an IOS developer from [Wakelet](https://wakelet.com).
